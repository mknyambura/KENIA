#### How to access the files?
First you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. If you're cloning using <em>HTTPS</em>, you'll get a link in this format: <code><strong>https://github.com/your-username/name-of-github-repository-.git</strong></code>. If you're cloning using SSH, you'll need to make sure you have an ssh-key first, after which you can use the ssh link to clone the respository in the following format:  <code><strong>git@github.com:your-username/name-of-the-github-repository.git</strong></em>

After obtaining this, head over to your terminal and type: <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/name-of-github-repository-.git</code> OR <code> git clone git@github.com:your-username/name-of-the-github-repository.git</code>

Alternatively, you can download the zip file by selecting the <strong>"Download ZIP"</strong> option after which you'll unzip it to access the files.

#### Editors

My primary editor is VS Code and Atom. However you can use online editors such as <a href="vscode.dev">vscode.dev</a>, <a href="github.dev">github.dev</a>, <a href="codepen.io">codepen.io</a> among others
